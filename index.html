        <h2>The Print Shop</h2>
        <p>The Lennar Store has created a one stop print shop for all Lennar Associates. We take care of all Lennar printing needs including but not limited to promotional products, signs, and trade show supplies. We were created to produce all
          material needed for the Nationâ€™s number one home builder and it's members.</p>
        <p>Since 2009 the Lennar Store has strived to help reduce the cost and production time for LENNAR Associates across the country. Providing a central location where Associates can go to find all of the materials and products that they need in
          one place. We've worked with multiple divisions within LENNAR to give them solutions to make their jobs easier. Printing materials, ordering products, allowing divisions to share marketing ideas through products on our store, customizing
          content on the store to help our fellow Associates succeed, and cutting costs so Associates can focus their money, time, and energy towards other aspects of their work.</p>
